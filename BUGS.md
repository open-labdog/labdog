# Bug Registry

Open bugs in LabDog. New entries are added as bugs are surfaced.

## Convention: open-only

**Only open bugs belong in this file.** When a bug is fixed:

1. Land the fix and write a descriptive commit message that references
   the bug ID (e.g. `fix(sync): BUG-37 — dispatch Celery tasks after
   commit`). That commit message is the canonical record (symptom,
   root cause, fix).
2. Delete the entry from this file in the same commit. Do **not** mark
   bugs `[x]` and leave them here — fixed entries belong in git history,
   not in the registry.

To retrace a historical bug ID referenced elsewhere
(`BUG-NN`, `SEC-NN`, `TYPE-NN`, `DEAD-NN`), search the commit log:

```
git log --grep BUG-37
git log -- backend/app/api/sync.py
```

## How to file an entry

Format each entry as:

    - [ ] **BUG-NN** `path/to/file.ext:LINE` — one-line summary

      Symptom, root cause, severity tier (Critical / High / Medium /
      Low). If reproduced from a specific scenario, note it. Group
      related bugs under the same severity heading.

ID counter as of last housekeeping pass: `BUG-44`, `SEC-06`,
`TYPE-03`, `DEAD-01`. Pick the next number in the relevant series
when filing a new entry.
